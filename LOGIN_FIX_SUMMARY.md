# Login Issue - FIXED ✅

## Problem
The mobile app was unable to connect to the backend server because the IP address was incorrect.

## Root Cause
- **Old IP in .env:** `192.168.1.144`
- **Actual Computer IP:** `192.168.12.132`

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated `.env` file
```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://192.168.12.132:3001
```

### 2. Updated `lib/config.js`
Added fallback to the correct IP address:
```javascript
BACKEND_URL: process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL || 'http://192.168.12.132:3001',
```

### 3. Added Better Logging to Backend
- MongoDB connection status
- Login attempt logging
- User lookup confirmation

## Verification
✅ Backend server is running on port 3001
✅ MongoDB is connected successfully
✅ Server is accessible from network IP (192.168.12.132)
✅ Database connection confirmed

## Next Steps
1. **Restart your Expo app** to pick up the new environment variable:
   ```bash
   # Stop the current Expo server (Ctrl+C)
   npm start
   # or
   npx expo start
   ```

2. **Try logging in again** - it should work now!

## Important Notes
- Your computer's IP address may change if you reconnect to Wi-Fi
- If login stops working, check your current IP with: `ipconfig getifaddr en0`
- Update the `.env` file with the new IP if it changes
- Make sure your phone/simulator is on the same Wi-Fi network as your computer

## Test Credentials
Use the credentials from your database to test the login.
