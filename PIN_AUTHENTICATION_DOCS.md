## 🔒 Security Features

### Brute Force Protection
Your PIN system includes **progressive lockout** to prevent brute force attacks:

| Failed Attempts | Lockout Duration | Status |
|----------------|------------------|---------|
| 1-4 attempts   | No lockout       | ⚠️ Warning shown with remaining attempts |
| 5-9 attempts   | 5 minutes        | 🔒 Account locked |
| 10-14 attempts | 15 minutes       | 🔒 Account locked |
| 15-19 attempts | 30 minutes       | 🔒 Account locked |
| 20+ attempts   | 60 minutes       | 🔒 Account locked |

**Key Security Features:**
- ✅ PIN is hashed using bcrypt (salt rounds: 12) before storage
- ✅ Failed attempts tracked per device
- ✅ Automatic lockout after threshold
- ✅ Counter resets on successful login
- ✅ Device-specific authentication (no cross-device PIN conflicts)
- ✅ Visual feedback showing remaining attempts

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Database Schema (User Model)
```javascript
pinDevices: [{
    deviceId: String,           // Unique device identifier
    pinHash: String,            // Bcrypt hashed PIN
    deviceName: String,         // Device name for user reference
    createdAt: Date,           // When PIN was set up
    lastUsed: Date,            // Last successful login
    failedAttempts: Number,    // Failed login counter
    lockedUntil: Date,         // Lockout expiration time
    lastFailedAttempt: Date    // Last failed attempt timestamp
}]
```

## 📱 User Flow

### First Time Login Flow
```
1. User enters email/password → Login successful
2. System checks if PIN is setup for this device
3. If NO PIN setup:
   ├─ Show PIN Setup Screen
   ├─ User creates 4-digit PIN
   ├─ User confirms PIN
   ├─ PIN is hashed and stored
   └─ Navigate to Dashboard
4. If PIN already setup:
   └─ Navigate to Dashboard
```

### Returning User Flow (PIN Enabled)
```
1. App checks AsyncStorage for 'PIN_ENABLED' flag
2. If PIN enabled:
   ├─ Show PIN Login Screen
   ├─ User enters 4-digit PIN
   ├─ Backend verifies PIN
   │   ├─ Valid: Login successful → Dashboard
   │   └─ Invalid: Show error + attempts remaining
   └─ Option to "Login with password" → Regular login
3. If PIN not enabled:
   └─ Show regular Login Form
```

### Failed Attempts Flow
```
User enters wrong PIN
├─ Attempts 1-4: Show warning with remaining attempts
│   └─ Display progress bar (5/5, 4/5, 3/5, etc.)
├─ Attempt 5: Account locked for 5 minutes
├─ Attempt 10: Account locked for 15 minutes
├─ Attempt 15: Account locked for 30 minutes
└─ Attempt 20+: Account locked for 60 minutes

Successful Login → Reset failed attempts to 0
```

## 🔧 Implementation Files

### New Files Created:
1. **`/lib/deviceId.js`** - Device ID utilities
2. **`/components/login/PinSetupScreen.jsx`** - PIN setup UI
3. **`/components/login/PinLoginScreen.jsx`** - PIN login UI

### Modified Files:
1. **`/models/User.js`** - Added pinDevices schema with security fields
2. **`/backend/server.js`** - Added 4 PIN-related endpoints
3. **`/lib/auth-final.js`** - Added PIN authentication methods
4. **`/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`** - Added PIN login support
5. **`/components/login/LoginForm.jsx`** - Integrated PIN setup flow
6. **`/app/index.jsx`** - Smart routing between PIN/password login

---

## 🚀 How It Works

### Device Identification
The system uses `expo-application` to get a unique installation ID:
```javascript
import * as Application from 'expo-application';

const deviceId = await Application.getInstallationIdAsync();
// Returns: "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
```

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Unique per app installation
- ✅ Persists across app launches
- ✅ Reset when app is uninstalled
- ✅ Different for each device
- ✅ Enables multiple users with same PIN on different devices

### PIN Storage & Verification
```javascript
// Setup (Backend)
const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs');
const pinHash = await bcrypt.hash(pin, 12); // Salt rounds: 12

// Verification (Backend)
const isPinValid = await bcrypt.compare(enteredPin, storedPinHash);
```

### Attempt Tracking
```javascript
// On failed login:
failedAttempts++;
if (failedAttempts >= 5) {
  lockedUntil = new Date(now + 5 * 60000); // 5 minutes
}

// On successful login:
failedAttempts = 0;
lockedUntil = null;
```

## 📊 Security Best Practices Implemented

✅ **Hashing:** PIN is never stored in plain text  
✅ **Salt:** Unique salt per PIN (bcrypt handles this)  
✅ **Rate Limiting:** Progressive lockout prevents brute force  
✅ **Device-Specific:** PIN conflicts impossible between devices  
✅ **Attempt Tracking:** Per-device failure tracking  
✅ **Auto-Reset:** Attempts reset on successful login  
✅ **Timeout:** Automatic unlock after lockout period  
✅ **User Feedback:** Clear error messages and warnings  
✅ **Fallback:** Can always use password login

## 🧪 Testing the System

### Test Scenario 1: First Time Setup
1. Login with email/password
2. See PIN setup screen
3. Enter PIN: 1234
4. Confirm PIN: 1234
5. See success animation
6. Navigate to dashboard
7. Logout
8. See PIN login screen on next launch

### Test Scenario 2: Failed Attempts
1. Enter wrong PIN 3 times
2. See "2 attempts remaining"
3. See progress bar decrease
4. Enter wrong PIN 2 more times
5. See "Account locked for 5 minutes"
6. Try to login → See error
7. Wait 5 minutes → Can try again

### Test Scenario 3: Multiple Devices
1. User A sets PIN "1234" on Device 1
2. User B sets PIN "1234" on Device 2
3. Both can login successfully
4. No conflict because deviceId is different

---

## 📝 Configuration

### Adjusting Lockout Thresholds
Edit `/backend/server.js` around line 566:

```javascript
// Current settings
if (failedAttempts >= 20) lockoutMinutes = 60;
else if (failedAttempts >= 15) lockoutMinutes = 30;
else if (failedAttempts >= 10) lockoutMinutes = 15;
else if (failedAttempts >= 5) lockoutMinutes = 5;

// Example: Stricter security
if (failedAttempts >= 3) lockoutMinutes = 10;
```

### Changing Hash Strength
Edit `/backend/server.js` around line 414:

```javascript
const saltRounds = 12; // Higher = more secure but slower
// Recommended: 10-12 for production
```

## 🎯 Answer to Your Question

**Q: What if two users choose the same PIN?**

**A: No problem! Each PIN is device-specific.**

Here's why it works:
```
User A on iPhone:
  - deviceId: "ABC-123"
  - PIN: 1234
  - Stored as: (deviceId: ABC-123, pinHash: $2a$12...)

User B on Android:
  - deviceId: "XYZ-789"
  - PIN: 1234
  - Stored as: (deviceId: XYZ-789, pinHash: $2a$12...)

When logging in:
  1. System queries: deviceId + PIN
  2. User A's iPhone → Matches ABC-123 + 1234 → User A logged in
  3. User B's Android → Matches XYZ-789 + 1234 → User B logged in
```

**The PIN is NOT a unique identifier.**  
It's a convenience feature linked to device + user combination.

## 🔐 Security Summary

Your implementation includes:
- **5 failed attempts** before lockout (configurable)
- **Progressive lockout times** (5, 15, 30, 60 minutes)
- **Bcrypt hashing** with salt rounds 12
- **Device-specific** authentication
- **Visual countdown** and feedback
- **Automatic reset** on success
- **Persistent tracking** in database

This provides **excellent protection** against:
- ✅ Brute force attacks
- ✅ Automated PIN guessing
- ✅ Credential stuffing
- ✅ Rainbow table attacks (due to hashing)

---

## 📞 Support

If you need to adjust any security parameters, lockout times, or UI elements, all the code is well-documented and modular. Each component and function has clear responsibilities.
